# Sales-Analysis-through-RFM-technique-by-using-SQL-AND-Tableau

Description: 

•	Dataset name - Sales_data_sample.xlsx
•	This data set for this project is obtained through Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data
•	It has 2,823 rows and 25 columns comprising headers like the Product line, order number, status, and order date, the date is broken down into year, months, and quarters, quantity, sales, MSRP, price, deal size, product code, customer’s name, address, and other info, etc.

•	In this project, I have imported the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and analyzed sales using basic SQL queries as well as complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions and created a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. I have also used tableau for creating meaningful visualizations and interactive dashboards.
